# Plasma Etching

Plasma etching replace [[wet etching]], because:

1. Plasma environment supply a more vigorously etching condition;

2. Plasma etching can practice directional or anisotropic etching.

Plasma produce:

1. Low pressure, 1 mtorr ~ 1 torr;  

2. RF generator usually operation at 13.56 MHz;

3. Gas atoms are ionized, producing positive ions and free electrons.
