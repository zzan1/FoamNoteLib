# EBL Setup

- 详细的 EBL 曝光的参数设定

- 有针对 EBL 刻蚀特点做相应的结构补偿；

- Back scattered electrons was negligible because of carbon;

- The variation of diamond thickness will cause the small error of the EBL focus, causing inhomogeneity of the grating;

- The HSQ resist after 60 min hard-bake is enough to etch diamond up to ~7um;

## MIBK & HSQ

For better structure (bellow 40nm), the HSQ should be diluted by MIBK(1:1).
