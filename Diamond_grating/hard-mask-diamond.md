# Hard Mask Diamond

## Metal
For aluminum:

Pros: 
1. Selectivity: 1:100;
2. hard adhesion;

Cons:
1. Micro hard mask effect during deep-etching;

## Dielectric film
For $SiO_2$, $Al_2O_3$:

Pros:
1. Neglectable micro mask effect;
2. High etching rate and good selectivity: 1:50;


Cons:
1. Low adhesion of silicon oxide layers on diamond can result in delamination;
2. large internal stress leading to crack.
3. Adhesion layer such as titanium and chromium was needed.
4.
