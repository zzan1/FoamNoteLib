# > High aspect ratio optical gratings in diamond

## Highlights

1. Nanoimprint lithography;
2. Clear description RIE plasma etching;

## Need to know

1. High plasma density is in order to get higher etching rate and more smooth etched surface;
2. High plasma density mechanisms include electron cyclotron resonance(ECR, TODO) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP);

3. Crystal bond 509, adhesive;

4. Parallax method and **cross section measurements** is associated.

## Fabrication process

### Step 1. Clean

10 min `Piranha` -> `Isopropanol` -> `Water` -> `N2 dry`;

### Step 2. Deposition

### Step 3. Pattern

### Step 4. RIE etching

#### Etching diamond using Al hard mask

Selectivity up to 50 or higher between diamond and Al;

The sputter of Al is highly depended on the ion radiation angle.

Faceting effect;

For narrow grating lines, the receding edges soon lead to the complete removal of the mask;

Micro mask effect:

1. Add SiF6 gas and use a thick Al mask;
2. Low pressure cause large mean free path of sputtered mask materials so they are highly deposited on the opposite wall;
3. Si mask is useful but it can't eliminate this problem.

For better etching thickness control:

1. Take the sample out and measured the depth by SEM;
2. Parallax is not precise enough so that the sample was cracked to precisely measure the etched depth and for better etching control;

### Polycrystalline versus single crystal sample

There little to no difference between above two;

The only difference is that the surface of polycrystalline is more polished.

## TODO

1. Optimal grating parameters calculate. [21 - 23 ];
2. Parallax method that directly measure the thickness;
3. Hard mark choose PPT;
